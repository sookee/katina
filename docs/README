BUILDING
========

Build from the folder build-debug

Katina will install into $PREFIX/bin and $PREFIX/lib. By default $PREFIX == $HOME.

Create Makefile.local to set PREFIX like in Makefile.local.example.

DO NOT add Makefile.local to git, add it to .gitignore

make // build application
make install // install application

There is an example launch script that needs tailoring to specific needs "katina.sh.example"
